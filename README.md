# AsyncSwift

For anyone looking into the up and coming async/await features for swift, this is a package that should
build and run using the development snapshot toolchain found [here](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots)

I'm excited to see these new features begin to take shape. I had a lot of trouble figuring out exactly how to "preview" them. Possibly helpful resources for cool swift package manager features can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageDescription.md)
